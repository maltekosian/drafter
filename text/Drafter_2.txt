Once I added drafter.html, which is a initial sketch. It may
contain code, that might work, but never meant to do so. The
editor seams to be fully implemented although it needs to be
tested and indeed I have to do a lot of makeup. Optical and
functional ones. And more testing.

With game_prototype.js I added a second sketch. This time for the
game. Here I have to work on the code. Basically the code
demonstrates the possibility of my thinking, of the idea, which
is not so new.

Jet the sun is shining again.
The idea once had been called self and smalltalk.

Both so called self containing environments, which means that you
execute the program code that you have written inside the
environment. Those things are IDEs combined with a VM or a
runtime environment.

So is web - a technology, environment to develop and deploy and
also learn the technology. But besides those you can learn and
create many other things.

This is my plan: an self containing IDE for the web, for games,
for storytelling games.

All this because tools are important.
My favorite tool is a text-editor called editplus. For versioning
I use GIT and my GITHUB account. And I use browsers: essentially
the chrome browser in it's latest iteration - canary. Besides
this one the Firefox and Aurora, IE 11, Opera. A lot of testing
tools.

Tools are important for (game) development. One of the reasons,
why I'm writing a tool, anyone can use to edit a tool the story
game engine. finally I will use both, to write a story-based 
5 times 5 tile game. a sort of story puzzle.
