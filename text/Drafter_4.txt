Maintenance and Support

It is hard to maintain a tool like the hogventure draftercraft
editor, if you are alone on your own. If this piece of software
has more than one component, a note editor, a drawing tool, a
music composer, a source-editor, a media manager and translator
on the client side, on server side a login, chat, persistent
storage, share and cooperative work, it was impossible.

That's a full time job.

I do not have so much time, a good reason to make QA, the Quality
Assurance, easier for me now. Spare time is a rare source in my
life.
Also I want to make games, build more advanced tutorials. I want
to show you how to's. Like:
- adding background-images to notes.
- formatting the text
- creating an editor with the game-engine
- embedding foreign, external sources to create 3d games

I'm willing to add and discus more advanced tips and tricks.

So today's maintenance is a bug fix for the delete connection
method, the new features edit connection and the upload to
dropbox and download from dropbox buttons. It is an option in the 
preference dialog, which is also new.

Still I'm working on the windosws8 version and the google
webstore app.

Ooh, I have almost forgotten to mention the feedback button on
the right hand side of draftercraft.

Whenever you have a feature request, want some hints, have other
suggestions, please feel free NOT TO SCREAM AT ME!!! Even if you
find a bug or something that looks like one, report it to me.

Like this evil thing: After installing the Application with the
install button - I used Firefox - export and build options do not
work. The file has the size of 0kb. Please fix this bug ....

Hm, there is a little problem. I can not fix it. This is a known
issue with the current versions of Firefox OS apps on desktop
environments. Not very well documented, by the way. How should
you know?
I will try to find a work around, if I can identify a Firefox app
via code. (Meanwhile the problem is double fixed. I've build in a 
work around - export via copy and paste - and Firefox Apps seems 
to be bug-fixed.)
Telling me about your wishes, your use cases and experiences will
help me to improve the app. I need your support. Please try the
app and tell me and your friends.

Use the feedback button on the right of the app.
Use the disqus forms. Email me. And if you want to support the 
app use the social buttons to tell your friends and followers.
Please feel free to review the code on <a 
href="http://github.com/maltekosian/drafter" 
target="_blank">github.com/maltekosian/drafter</a>, because 
hogventure's draftercraft is open source. May mention the donate 
button on the left?
