Creating a twine like game and editor in html and javascript.
As if i haven't done it thousend times - more or less. More 
less than less or never. I've done it often enough before.

Once I started with Java, the good old way with applets in HTML 
pages and Applications. Scripting was a problem, data either.
So I had have chosen XML - a HTML like data-language anyone
can adopt to her own way.
Java was great - Applets in the late 90's, early 2000's super
hyper advanced. It was way much better than Flash back in this 
years. Meanwhile now a days it is odd. Realy odd. 
Even the company that created Java is out of business. The SUN
was going down.

But the night was short.
Javascript, V8, HTML5 was rising at the horizon, thanks to 
Google, Firefox and Linux's KHTML webkit.
Native web technology for the natives of the web since the early
1990's.

So I've already made this editor and games with this editor.
I made games, a lot of games. It is a casuality for me.

I made a lot of versions of the editor in Java and Javascript.

And now again?
Yes, but there is a reason.
This is something I want to write about.
A making of story as you can imagine.
This is not only may making of story it will be also yours.
Part of the story will be the code, the comments, the resons why,
the circumstances, the motivations - I promise.
I do not know, if I will be able to fullfill the whole promise, 
but I do try.

I explained my choice of language mixure, Javascript, the script
language of the web and HTML5, the hyper text markup language.
