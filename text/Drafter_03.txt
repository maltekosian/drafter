It's now 14 days ago, when I started with a complete rewrite 
of my tool drafter. Drafter was and is a html5, javascript 
based tool for writing story based games. A mixture between 
twine and articy draft. The first versions had been written 
in java continuously public available since 2004. It changed 
it's name and some features. With the previous version of 
drafter you were able to work cooperative after you logged 
in via internet, import images, sounds and script javascript 
based plugins for specific notes. But no one used all these 
great features of drafter.
If anyone used drafter, they only created some notes.
(In twine notes are named passages.)

This last version is stripping off features. It seems like 
twine. 
The difference is small. Twine's HTML5 version may look 
better, but you can not change the game-engine with enhanced 
features or the editor like changing the look and feel of 
the resulting game, importing, editing images, composing 
music or whatever you like. With twine you can change each 
passage with plugin, in drafter you could change everything.

But why I did this?
Why it took just some spare time of 14 days?

Last question is easy to answer. I have a lot of experience, 
indeed, especially in the topic of game tools programming 
for stories. The tool is simple and simple to use. It 
follows the KISS paradigm.

The first question is complicated.
What did you want to know?
Why I did the rewrite or why made it similar but not the 
same like twine?

The rewrite happened, because I accepted the challenge.
I was asked about drafter at the 2014 GDC. What happened to 
the tool? 
Later I joined following twitter conversation:

What to say? Challenge accepted, <a

accomplished</a>!

These are the features of the current version of 'drafter':
- save and load to the browser's local storage
- add, edit and delete notes
- add and delete connections to/from notes
- visualization of notes and connections
- toggle between note- and script editor
- test game and stop the test
- zoom note editor overview
- ex- and import to/from your local hard-drive
- build the complete game as a HTML-file
- help complete with a mini tutorial
- install 'drafter' to your computer with the Firefox  
  browser
I build a Windows8 version, which I may publish to windows 
store later. Also I may build a google webstore version, if
you really want.

But to be honest the story of how and why I made the tool is 
not finished.

Why the story has to be continued...
