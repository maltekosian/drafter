Dear Serpentine Galleries employees.

My name is Malte Kosian. I'm an artist, web & game developer from Hamburg.
Currently I'm working on a project in Web VR to rebuild some (London) galleries.
Especially yours.
 
Some detail about the project: https://hogventure.com/Your_Gallery_VR_online.html
A minimal viable preview you can watch here: https://hogventure.com/games/exp/gVR-slacker.html
(needs chrome dev or firefox aurora, because it is very new technology)

I would like to create a more precicse impression of the interiors, besides the interesting
problem of the Kensington Garden with the pavilion temporally buildings. Therefor I need
your help. I need accurate floorplans with the correct measurements.
Can you deliver those to me? It would be really awesome helpful.
It might be kind, if I could also have some good images of the empty galleries for the virtual reconstructions.

For questions please feel free to contact me.
I will also be in London this weekend (Fr-Mo).

Best Regards
Malte Kosian
